# LawTalk-AI

Developed a conversational AI system called LawTalk AI to enhance legal awareness and accessibility for marginalized groups. This system incorporates LLM technology, RAG approach, and Meta-NLP for multilingual capabilities, ensuring accurate legal information dissemination. Additionally, a graph-based learning model is integrated to educate users on their rights, with a focus on web accessibility for individuals with disabilities.
